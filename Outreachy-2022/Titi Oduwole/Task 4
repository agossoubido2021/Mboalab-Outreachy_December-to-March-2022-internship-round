#IMPROVE DIAGNOSTICS OF TYPHOID THROUGH OPEN SCIENCE: AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-BASED TECHNIQUE

##PROJECT GOALS, RELEVANCE AND OBJECTIVES
This project aims to close the gaps observed in the diagnosis of Typhoid or Enteric Fever by combining Aritificial systems (AI) with **irreplaceable** human clinicians.
Mboalab plans to achieve this goal by;

1. Using the microculture test with the blood which seems to be the best accepted by the laboratory technicians
2. Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) as algorithms on the collected images to train the algorithm

The following will be achieved:

1.Confirmation of diagnosis
2. Determination of the level of severity of the disease

#MBOALAB PROJECT TOOLS: _DATA COLLECTION TOOL_

Mbolab prides itself in its focus on making biotechnology research and tools more accessible to labs around the world through scientific research and development and local production of reagents.
Mboalab is committed to the development of open educational resources as well as simple and cost effective protocols that can be applied in resource-limited laboratories.
In our latest project: **Improve diagnostics of typhoid through Open Science: An Artificial Intelligence-based technique**, one of such tools used is a **DATA COLLECTION TOOL**

Mboalab, recognising the importance of needed information for this project to achieve its goals and objectives and discovering that a major challenge faced in the diagnosis of typhoid fever in Cameroon and in Africa is the **availability of local and high quality open data**,
realised the need to gather data and by the _most fitting and preferred_ data collection tool. The Dataset will be Open, Interoperable and aligned with the Metadata Schema 4.4 (https://schema.datacite.org)

> A data collection tool refers to the devices/instruments used to collect data.
-by formpl.us
Examples questionnnaires, surveys, interviews, etc.

Choosing the best data collection tool was based on goals and objectives of the project and on the following factors:

-It should be addressed to the local health care professionals and practitioners affiliated to and having access to patients data records
-It should enable acquisition of prospective and retrospective datasets
It should take into account local and content specifities, (language, access to specific resources, etc)

It was an interesting part of the project choosing our most preferred data collection tool. _Many thanks to all our contributors_
As we share our data and share insights from the analysis of the dataset, you will agree with us that we indeed chose right.
