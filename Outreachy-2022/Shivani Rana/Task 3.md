# TASK 3 :  Data Collection Tool

- The selected tool for collecting reliable fitting data is 'Google Forms'
- I have created a questionnaire which takes answers in form of numerical as well as categorical data.
- The form can be accessed from [here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeSVvGIn7CBzmQcrreBdpfV3OOXZfaXaUKAQkJW1qL2LqghJQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)

Note:
- The form may need more questions to be added which can be included after valuable suggestions from community and mentors.
- The main focus is on the tool and its reliability.
- The collected data can be stored in rows and columns with timestamps in spreadsheet format.
