-------
- [x] Update the logo
	- The versions of the logo (migration can be found) via [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0MW7v9ZfVjhqQ3f20kQbL2/Typhoid-Fever--early-diagnosis-%7C-Logo?node-id=0%3A1)

- [x] Create Data Collection tool

	1. Build front-end of the data collection tool. 
    
        NOTE: The earlier versions of the Online Platform and Data Collections were in green colors. To make logo match with broader range of researchs including data collection and early-diagnosis tools with Clinicians + AI, the main color - green has been changed and the icon of Typhoid Fever has been replaced by the plus sign implying the relevance of medical sphere in the project.
        
        The initial design has been integrated on behalf of the new version of logo. More details can be found via [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0MW7v9ZfVjhqQ3f20kQbL2/Typhoid-Fever--early-diagnosis-%7C-Logo?node-id=0%3A1)
    
	3. Build and migrate with Backend. The credentials of the datas could be visualized/analyzed [here](https://ftdiagnose.pythonanywhere.com/swagger/).

- [x] Updates in Online Platform:
   1. Migration with a logo version 2.0.0
   2. Add Follow us links in Online Platform
   3. Update Blogs page in Online Platform
   4. Add Survey Page in Online Platform

# **SYNOPSIS**

Typhoid or Enteric fever disease caused by Salmonella Typhi remains a serious health problem worldwide including in Cameroon, Africa. Despite the conventional methods of diagnosing Typhoid such as:
Isolating the causative organism from the body fluids
Antibody detection tests
the misdiagnosis is present due to the lack of advanced evaluation in both methods.
The focus of Mboalb is combining AI systems with an irreplaceable human clinician to bring an innovative solution for an early and better diagnosis.

The goal is to use the microcultures test with the blood which seems to be the best accepted by the laboratory technicians. To train the algorithm, using CNNs as algorithms on the collected images is proposed.
The choice of the algorithm will depend on the volume of the images obtained and/or in hand. In the case of having fewer images, the Transfer Learning method could be used to automate the test of microbiological cultures.


### **CURRENT STATUS OF THE PROJECT**

Depending on the research by the team, the Transfer Learning method is reliable at 61%, and to reinforce the reliability of this test using the second algorithm which is a fast decision tree learner is planned. This algorithm based on 18 symptoms variables will allow research not only to confirm the diagnosis but above all to determine the level of severity of the disease. The main challenge of the project is the availability of local and high-quality open data.
