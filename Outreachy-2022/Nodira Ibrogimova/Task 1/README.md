# Research
Concerns while building logo:

Tasks to research:
1. Does ***Mbolab*** aim to focus only providing early-diagnosis tools for Typhoid Fever or expanding the target area is planned? 

    *For example, working on diverse fields of health problems, providing research and early diagnosis tools would be the case.*

2. What are the preferences for colors?
3. What are the preferences for the style: 

    *dynamic, playful, modern, timeless, creative, techy, etc.*?

**TDD** approach:
- Confirm the specifications of the logo to design an online platform. The colors of the logo matter in the (material) design of the front-end view.
- Once logo is confirmed, a Figma version of the websiteâ€™s design is created.

# Result
The initial logo and a logo dedicated for an actual focus of the project are listed in the design file.

The focus of the project is Typhoid Fever. The design of the logo (including the project name) is a target of this task.

Initial logo has been made regarding the general Mboalab project itself, while in the next version, I built upon the feedback of the mentor and veryfying the scope of the project in more details.

I used the shape of the Salmonella typhi to give the sense of the bacteria causing Typhoid Fever. In addition, provided idea for the name of the project.

To make logo match with broader range of researchs including data collection and early-diagnosis tools with *Clinicians + AI*, in another version of the logo the main color - green has been changed and the icon of Typhoid Fever has been replaced by the plus sign implying the relevance of the medical sphere in the project.

Several versions of the logo are presented via the link below.

The design of the logo is available at [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0MW7v9ZfVjhqQ3f20kQbL2/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1)
