#PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project is to improve diagnostics of typhoid through Open Science: An Artificial Intelligence-based technique.

#CONTEXT

Typhoid or Enteric Fever is one of the infectious human diseases in Cameroon and Africa and is considered a serious health problem world wide.

Misdiagnosis is usually experienced as most health facilities us only WIDAL Test without confirmation of results with a second test method.

#OPPORTUNITIES AND SOLUTION

In healthcare, we cannot ignore the importance of human intelligence and so cannot replace it fully with AI, so we will combine AI systems with an irreplaceable human clinician to advance better diagnosis.
We will use the **microculture test with blood**, as it is accepted as best by lab technicians.

The algorithm will be based on 18 symptoms variable, which will help us confirm diagnosis and to determine the level of severity of the disease.
**Main challenge: AVAILABILITY OF LOCAL AND HIGH QUALITY OPEN DATA**

#TASK

Design a Data Collection tool to record Symptoms Data

##IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DATA COLLECTION TOOL

-It should be addressed to local health care professionals and practitioners affiliated to and having access to patients data records
-The tool should enable acquisition of prospective and retrospective dataset.
-The tool should take into account local and context specifities (language, access to specific resources, etc)
-The developed tool can take many forms eg, surveys, questionnaires, interviews etc

#THE PREFERRED AND MOST FITTING TOOL:

-## GOOGLE FORM

Reason for this choice of data collection tool are;
-It is **open source** (which aligns with Mboalab's objectives)
-It is adaptable (good for surveys, questionnaires, interviews, etc)
-You can set questions and dependencies

#NOTE
The above collection tool can **easily** be created on an offline tool as well.
