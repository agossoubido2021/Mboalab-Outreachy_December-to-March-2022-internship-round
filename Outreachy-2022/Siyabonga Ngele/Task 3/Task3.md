# Design a Data Collection Tool

The objective of this task is to design the data collection system that will be use to collect typhoid fever clinical data (symptoms variables that will allow us not only to confirm the diagnosis but above all to determine the level of severity of the disease).
This will be achieved by considering local and context specificities (Language, access to specific resources etc..).

For this task, I choose google forms. For the following reasons:
- It allows for easy online availability
- It allows for easy translation to languages like French or the other 13 African languages.
- Due to a lack of connectivity / technological devices google form can be saved to pdf form and used as printed form.

[Typhoid Diagnostics Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeNFwChuyRmQIObgJeJ3Agrt4zVAyBpvrSODUP4fMWuWYfcqQ/viewform?usp=pp_url)

The Google form is easy to complete but requires practitioner to recieve patient consent to record medical records.
