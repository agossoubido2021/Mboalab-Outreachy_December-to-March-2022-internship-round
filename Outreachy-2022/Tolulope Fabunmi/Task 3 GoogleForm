I have created a data collection tool which is majorly focused on the Knowledge, Attitude and Practices of Non Health Workers, gathering responses from patients, community members who have had Typhoid fever related symptoms, have taken part in any of the diagnostic approaches readily available, their mode of treatment and other important questions to aid in the research.

I created this data collection form for non health workers so as to help solve the major challenge the project is facing on availability of local and high-quality open data.

I used GoogleForm and provided the average time needed to complete the survey. However other collection tools like Survey CTO, ODK, KoBOToolBox are available. This is just a template.

This is the link to the form ** https://forms.gle/8wVaCiTV5JYbmRKg9 **

Thanks in anticipation.
