### Build an Online Platform for the Project

I have made a few adjustments to the project website, i added  two new sections, __communities__ and __data collection__ to shed more light on our mentors, sponsors and the contributors we accept for this project.
There are a few tutorial clips as well to assist first time users trying to get familiar with our data collection tool, little modifications were also made on the project relevance and objective pages.

I have included the project logo on the home page menu to stand out, i have also added it faintly to the background of the other menus and submenus so that it is subtly in the mind of users as they browse through our online platform, thereby making it easier for them to recall our project.

Here is the link to the reviewed [website](https://nancyfaks.wixsite.com/my-site)

Thank you.
