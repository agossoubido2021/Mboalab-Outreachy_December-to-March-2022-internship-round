## Design a Data Collection Tool to Record Typhoid Fever Symptoms Data

The objective of this task is to design the data collection system that will be used to collect typhoid fever clinical data symptom variables that will allow us not only to confirm the diagnosis but above all to determine the level of severity of the disease, taking into account, local and context specificities e.g, language.
This tool should enable the acquisition of datasets and be addressed to local healthcare professionals and practitioners, affiliated and having access to patient data records.

For this task, i made use of KoboToolbox to design a data collection tool in the form of a survey.
[KoboToolbox](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/) is a free and open source software with a suite of tools for data collection, using this software, i was able to customize my survey as i desired, i have also included english as the default language for my form with an option for french and this language option can be further edited to include other official languages of various nationalities.
This tool also allows for the collection of structured and unstructured data, with options for images and videos among others. Data can also be easily exported as an excel file, CSV etc
Visualizations can also be made using this tool both online and offline.

My survey can can be found [here](https://kf.kobotoolbox.org/#/forms)
