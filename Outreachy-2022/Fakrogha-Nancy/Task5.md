### Step by Step Process on How to Contribute to Project

#### Sending contributions
This step is for applicants who are sending in their contributions for the first time, please note that this tutorial majorly applies to the [Github online](https://github.com/) which is also commonly referred to as GitHub web browser or web user interface path as this has proved to be a lot easier to understand for beginners.

##### Step 1
__Fork the project to your GitHub account and clone it into your development environment__; For this step, you should go to the [mboalab project page](https://github.com/Mboalab/Mboalab-Outreachy_December-to-March-2022-internship-round), at the top right corner, you would find three buttons(__Unwatch__, __Star__, __Fork__), our only button of concern for this step is the __Fork__ button.
we should go ahead and click that, if in doubt, watch the video below to see where the fork button is located(for this example, i have used a random repository but your Web UI is placed in the same manner)

If you did that, you should notice that the repository has been forked and now has your name and / before the repository name.

##### Step 2
__Make sure to move to an outreachy-2022 branch before making changes in your working directory__; The Mboalab project directory currently has 2 branches, a __main__ branch and __outreachy-2022__ branch.
What you need to do is, click on the drop down arrow by the main branch, select the outreachy-2022 branch and make your changes there, if for any reason, your forked repository does not have an outreachy-2022 branch, you can create and check out to that branch following the step 2 of the migration section.

##### Step 3
__All contributions have to be listed in Outreachy-2022 folder__
* Create a folder with a naming convention [Applicant Name] (e.g John Smith) in Outreachy-2022; to create a folder, click on __add file__ in the __outreachy-2022 branch__, select __create new file__, enter your name and a backward slash(/). This creates your folder.

* List all your contributions in your [Applicant Name] folder in respective files Task0.md, Task1.md, and etc.; this step is similar to the previous and to add your contributions as files, you have to select the folder you created, click on "add file", then "create new file", then you name it according to the task number, for example, Task1.md,Task2.md, etc.
The main difference here is that you dont add the backward slash(/) at the end of the named file, this leaves it as a file and not a folder.

The video above shows the creation of a file and how you can always go back to that folder to create another or keep adding files to your folder.

##### Step 4
__Create a Pull Request and send updates to the outreachy-2022 branch__; To create a pull request, select your named folder, click on __contribute__, then go ahead and click on __open pull request__.
An important things to note is that you make sure when submitting your pull request, that your forked repository and the mboalab repository are all on the outreachy-2022 branch.

#### Migration
This section is for applicants who already have a forked repository and have previously submitted pull requests.

##### Step 1
__Sync your forked repository with the original repository and push the changes to your GitHub repository__; to do this, on the main branch of your forked repository, click on __Fetch Upstream__, then select __fetch and merge__.
I will create my example video using a random repository.

##### Step 2
__Create and checkout to a new branch outreachy-2022 Follow Sending Contributions section starting from Step 3__; creating a new branch is not outlined in the step 3 of the contributions section, so, to do that, click on your __main__ branch, in the space below, type your new branch name(outreachy-2022), click enter or create.

##### Step 3
__Once you have integrated your working directory with Step 3, remove all files you have added in the "Newcomer Tasks" folder__; for this step, click on starter tasks in your outreachy branch, then select the newcomer tasks folder, in that folder, choose whatever task folder for your previous task that was merged, eg. if you had previously contributed to task 3 and it was merged, you select task 3 folder, click on your named folder and look out for 3 dots(...), clicking on that will show you an option to "delete", select it.


##### Step 4
__Push your changes and send in a PR the bundle of your work integrated with requirements listed in Sending Contributions__; After concluding the steps above, on your forked repository homepage(or code page), ensure your outreachy branch is selected, if it is not, select it and click on contribute and open your pull request.
