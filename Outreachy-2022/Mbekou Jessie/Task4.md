## Description
The content for the online platform has been added directly to the site. Information on the website have been divided into different sections, starting from the home page with an overview of the Mboalab organization and ending with a contact section where you can send a message to the project mentors for inquiries.

### Data Collection Section
This section gives an overview of the project, the main challenge faced and proposed collection tool to help throughout the project. This collection tool is JotForm, which allows anyone to create and publish forms, integrate them into their site, collect data from their users and receive responses by email. JotForm can help in the good proceedings or progress of the project by aiding:
- Collect the associations of symptoms that confirm the disease and its level of severity from healthcare practitioners. 
- Collect images for our dataset taking into account the different ethnic groups, gender and age.
- Have an idea of the regions of the country having the highest number of cases as well as their age group.

JotForm can also be used as a means of payment collection for those willing to contribute financially to the project.

### Contribution Section
The contribution section is about the different forms of contribution which can be done for the progress of this project. Contributions can be:
- Through code
- By providing images for the project dataset
The different contributions are open to the public and links to proceed with their contributions given.
