## Task 3: Design a Data Collection Tool to Record Typhoid Fever Symptoms Data

## Objectives:
The objective of this task is to design the data collection system that will be use to collect thyphoid fever clinical data (symptoms variables that will allow us not only to confirm the diagnosis but above all to determine the level of severity of the disease).
The developed tool should be addressed to local health care professionals and practitionners affiliated and having access to patients data records; and should enable acquisition of prospective and retrospective Datasets.

## Tool Used:
I used JotForm (https://www.jotform.com/) as my data collection tool in the completion of this task. Jotform is a powerful online application that allows anyone to quickly create custom online forms. Using Jotform, you can create and publish forms, integrate them into your site, collect data from your users and receive responses by email. This app allows users to collect various types of data, such as voice recordings, barcodes, geolocations and electronic signatures and then build, view, access, sort, fill out, share, and organise all this data in a single place. It also allows payment collection.
JotForm is a web-based app, also available as Jotform Mobile for both Android and IOS devices. Jotform Mobile Form lets you work offline so you can collect data on the go. Once you’re back online, Jotform will sync your data automatically for an uninterrupted experience. It’s a great solution for field workers conducting field research without internet access as it allows submissions to be done even offline.

## Description
I was able to customize my questionnaire as desired and add a logo to the form. I also added English as default language as well as a French translation of the form. The form is linked to my gmail account, so I can receive submissions on the app and also via email. I also added a thank you page which is shown after the form has been submitted and it is also possible to add an autoresponder email to the person who fills the form.

Here is the link to my form https://form.jotform.com/212916022742045
