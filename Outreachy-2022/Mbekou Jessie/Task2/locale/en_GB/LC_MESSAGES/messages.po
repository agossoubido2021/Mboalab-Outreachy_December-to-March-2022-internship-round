In other words, sustainable local development needs to be thought by and for the members of a given community. </p><p class=\"mb-5\">To do so, it is important to break the unenthusiastic spirit that exists among many Cameroonians, by training healthy, educated citizens capable of critical thinking on issues related to their immediate environment. By choosing education and health as priority axes, associated with its role as a mediator between Science-Technologies-Societies; we can say clearly that Mboalab could be a powerful catalyst for local sustainable development.</p>"

Established in 2018, the lab currently runs a number of projects amongst which the open enzyme manufacturing project. At its core, our work in Mboalab Biotech is focused on making biotechnology research and tools more accessible to labs around the world through scientific research and development and local production of reagents. </p><p class=\"mb-4\">We are committed to the development of open educational resources as well as simple and cost-effective protocols that can be applied in resource-limited laboratories. We also provide scientific research projects targeting local health issues, internships opportunities, and training sessions to young local scientists in order to equip them with molecular biology and DIY- Biology skills, and prepare them for employment.</p>"

msgid "context_content"
msgstr "<p>Typhoid fever is a life-threatening infection caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi. It is usually spread through contaminated food or water. Once Salmonella Typhi bacteria are eaten or drunk, they multiply and spread into the bloodstream.<br>Urbanization and climate change have the potential to increase the global burden of typhoid. In addition, increasing resistance to antibiotic treatment is making it easier for typhoid to spread through overcrowded populations in cities and inadequate and/or flooded water and sanitation systems.<br>Typhoid or Enteric fever is one of the infectious human diseases in Cameroon and Africa. Outbreaks of typhoid fever caused by Salmonella typhi remains a serious health problem worldwide. There are a number of tests available presently, from molecular to immunological and biochemical to microbiological. Some well-known and conventional Method of Diagnosis of Typhoid Fever are :</p>"

msgid "microbiological_cultures"
msgstr "Microbiological cultures"

msgid "mc_content"
msgstr "The isolation of the causative organism, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (Salmonella Typhi), is the gold standard for the diagnosis (WHO, 2018). Body fluids like blood, bone marrow, stool, urine, rose spots, gastric and intestinal secretions may be cultured. Blood culture gives a definitive diagnosis. But, the use of bacteriological cultures for the diagnosis of typhoid infection is cost-intensive and technically difficult, hence the need for other diagnostic tests."

msgid "antibody_detection"
msgstr "Antibody detection tests"

msgid "ad_content"
msgstr "These are rapid serologic tests designed for early and easy point-of-care use. The Widal Test is based on the measurement of antibodies (agglutinins) against somatic (O) and flagellar (H) antigens of Salmonella typhi in the sera of patients. Widely used in many developing countries because of its low cost, Widal test is limited by lack of standardized methods of assay and misinterpretation of results. This has led to the overestimation of the number of patients presenting with acute febrile illnesses diagnosed with Typhoid fever. A systematic review by Mengist and Tilahun (2017) revealed poor reliability, low sensitivity and specificity of the Widal test."

msgid "misdiagnosis"
msgstr "So, misdiagnosis is usually experienced since most health care facilities use only Widal test without confirmation of results with a second test method. In addition, the diagnosis of Typhoid involves several levels of uncertainties. Patients cannot tell exactly how they feel, doctors and nurses cannot tell exactly what they observe."

msgid "opportunities"
msgstr "Opportunities and solution"

msgid "opportunities_content"
msgstr "<p>Augmented intelligence makes more sense than artificial intelligence, especially in tropical diseases such as Typhoid. This is because it highlights the enhanced capabilities of a human when augmented with the right tools and technologies. In a sensitive industry such as healthcare, human intelligence cannot be replaced. Augmented intelligence specifies systems that augment human intelligence rather than attempt to replace them. Combining AI systems with an irreplaceable human clinician can advance better diagnosis.</p><p>We propose to use the microcultures test with the blood which seems to be the best accepted by the laboratory technicians. We will use CNNs as algorithms on the collected images to train the algorithm. Everything will depend on the volume of images we have, if we have few we will use transfer learning to automate the test of microbiological cultures .As we saw above this test is reliable at 61% and to reinforce the reliability of this test we will use the second algorithm which is a fast decision tree learner. This algorithm based on 18 symptoma variables will allow us not only to confirm the diagnosis but above all to determine the level of severity of the disease. <strong> The main challenge our project is facing is availability of local and high quality open data.</strong> </p>"

msgstr "Proposed Tool"

msgid "tool_content"
msgstr "<p>With this main challenge stated above (that is: availability of local and high quality open data), we ought to seek for high quality tools to help collect reliable and accurate data for our project.<br>The proposed tool for our collection of data is JotForm (<a href=\"https://www.jotform.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.jotform.com/</a>), a powerful online application that allows anyone to quickly create custom online forms. Using Jotform, you can create and publish forms, integrate them into your site, collect data from your users and receive responses by email. This app allows users to collect various types of data, such as voice recordings, barcodes, geolocations and electronic signatures and then build, view, access, sort, fill out, share, and organise all this data in a single place. It also allows payment collection. </p><p>JotForm is a web-based app, also available as Jotform Mobile for both Android and IOS devices. Jotform Mobile Form lets you work offline, so you can collect data on the go. Once you’re back online, Jotform will sync your data automatically for an uninterrupted experience. It’s a great solution for field workers conducting field research without internet access as it allows submissions to be done even offline. </p>"
