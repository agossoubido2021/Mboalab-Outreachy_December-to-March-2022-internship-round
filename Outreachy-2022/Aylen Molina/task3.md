# Task 3: Design a Data collection tool to record Typhoid Fever symptoms Data

# QuestionPro

I have chosen a tool called QuestionPro because it is easy to use, it has shareable dashboards, you can export the data in .xls, .csv, .ppt, .pptx, .pdf and .docx format for free.

* Distribution

Reach respondents: Surveys can be distributed through various means such as email, social networks, websites and QR Codes.
App for offline surveys: The App can be used to conduct surveys offline on tablets or iOS or Android mobile devices.

* Data analysis

Real-time reports: Thanks to this you can instantly observe the data collected in the surveys.
Attractive reports: Data can be visualized in an attractive way thanks to graphical reports, statistics and infographics instantly.
Advanced Text Analysis: With this tool you can analyze the text responses provided by patients.

The analytics is very important, it shows us the number of total responses, the completion rate, the average time in which the survey has been completed, a map showing the countries where the patients are from. We can filter data, analyze trends, among other things.
I think this is a very important point, as it helps us to collect data efficiently and allows us to visualize it.
Local healthcare professionals and practitionners affiliated who have access will be able to view patient records without any problem.

# Survey

By researching and reading articles I have carefully chosen questions to collect symptom associations that confirm the disease.
