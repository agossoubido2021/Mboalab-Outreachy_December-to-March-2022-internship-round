Design Data Collection tool to record symptoms Data of Typhoid Fever

Tool Used: 

For this project contribution I made use of Typeform to create a form for prospective users of the form to fill out their details
https://oloruntobaalex25.typeform.com/to/ecxq5gYb

[Oluwayemisi_Oloruntoba_Task_3.xlsx](https://github.com/yemisi25/Mboalab-Outreachy_December-to-March-2022-internship-round/files/7449512/Oluwayemisi_Oloruntoba_Task_3.xlsx)

Limitation of the tool:

1. Due to the current basic plan of the tool, i couldn't not implement a Logic branch to some set of questions
to provide appropriate answer to some question such has (null, invalid/unknown ) answer we might get.

Null - Means no to choice questions
Invalid/unknown-  for optional question that our patients didn't have answer to 

2. Limitation on the number of questions in the form
