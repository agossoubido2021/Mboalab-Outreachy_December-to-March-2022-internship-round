## About

[Mboalab](https://www.mboalab.africa/) is an open and collaborative space located in Yaoundé, Cameroon. The aim of mboalab is to catalyze sustainable local development and improve people’s living conditions through open science.
Mboalab aims to:
* Provide community and lifelong education for the population, as well as formal education for the younger generations
* Serve as a platform for exchange on issues related to local context
* Mediate between local communities and academia
* Propose solutions that meet the needs of communities, using local knowledge and open digital technologies
* Raise public awareness of environmental issues
* Facilitate access to basic healthcare
## Project
### Improve Diagnostics of Typhoid through Open Science: An Artificial Intelligence-Based Technique

#### Project Description
[Typhoid fever](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/typhoid-fever/#:~:text=Typhoid%20fever%20is%20a%20bacterial,that%20cause%20salmonella%20food%20poisoning.) is caused by Salmonella typhi bacteria. Typhoid fever is rare in developed countries. It is still a serious health threat in the developing world, especially for children. Contaminated food and water or close contact with an infected person cause typhoid fever. Some well-known and conventional Method of Diagnosis of Typhoid Fever are:
* __Body Fluid or Tissue Culture (Microbiological Cultures):__ For the culture, a small sample of your blood, stool, urine or bone marrow is placed on a special medium that encourages the growth of bacteria. The culture is checked under a microscope for the presence of typhoid bacteria. A bone marrow culture often is the most sensitive test for Salmonella typhi.
* __Antibody Detection Tests (Widal Test):__ This is an indirect agglutination test for enteric fever or undulant fever whereby bacteria causing typhoid fever is mixed with a serum containing specific antibodies obtained from an infected individual.
* __Medical and Travel History:__ Your doctor is likely to suspect typhoid fever based on your symptoms and your medical and travel history. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by identifying Salmonella typhi in a culture of your blood or other body fluid or tissue.
Misdiagnosis is usually experienced since most health care facilities use only Widal test without confirmation of results with a second test method. Also, the diagnosis of Typhoid involves several levels of uncertainty. Patients cannot tell exactly how they feel, doctors and nurses cannot tell exactly what they observe.

#### Project Relevance
Mboalab aims to catalyze sustainable local development and improve people’s living condition through open science. This project is relevant to but not limited to Cameroon and developing or underdeveloped African country.
According to this recently compiled [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_African_countries_by_Human_Development_Index) of developed, developing and underdeveloped countries, using the human development index as a summary measure, we can see that Cameroon ranks at number 22 in Africa, 153rd position in the world and in the medium human development category with as many as 30 more countries following closely behind in the low human development category. Mboalab already aims to facilitate access to basic healthcare as one of its core missions, However, this project tackles one of the major issues prevalent in rural communities of developing and underdeveloped countries.
Typhoid Fever can be passed in the feces and sometimes in the urine of infected people. If you eat food that has been handled by someone who has typhoid fever and who hasn't washed carefully after using the toilet, you can become infected. most people become infected by drinking contaminated water. The bacteria may also spread through contaminated food and through direct contact with someone who is infected or through typhoid carriers (These people, known as chronic carriers, no longer have signs or symptoms of the disease themselves. However, they still shed the bacteria in their feces and are capable of infecting others).

#### Project Objectives
The main objective of this project is to create an algorithm based on 18 symptom variables will allow us not only to confirm the diagnosis of typhoid fever but above all to determine the level of severity of the disease in a cost-efficient manner. The challenge our project is facing is availability of local and high-quality open data. In a bid to fix that and set up a local and robust dataset aligned with the [Metadata Schema 4.4](https://schema.datacite.org/), we have outlined the following pathways;
* __Design interviews for practitioners in order to collect the associations of symptoms that confirm the disease and its level of severity.__
* __Images collection taking into account the different ethnic groups, gender and age in order to have a heterogeneous dataset to allow us to avoid the biases that may arise and undermine the use of our solution.__
* __Design the Convolutional Neural Networks to train images and Decision tree to train structured data.__

We are calling on the public to join our community and make this project a reality for every man, woman and child at risk of this disease around the world.
