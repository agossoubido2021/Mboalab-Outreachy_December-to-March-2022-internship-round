### Designing a Logo for the Project

For this revised design, i would like to draw your attention to the improvements made on my previous logo based off the comment instruction by the mentor.
I have made a reference to artificial/augmented intelligence with the use of an icon with a human head shape but instead of a human brain, what we have in it's place is a series of dots connected with wires.
i have created an acronym for this project, __MADOT__. It is short, easy to recall and consists of all the relevant parts, a detailed breakdown is;
* M - Mboalab
* A - Artificial Intelligence
* D - Diagnostics
* O - Open science
* T - Typhoid fever

In the logo, the O is symbolized to represent the presence of many organisms, it also acts as a reference to the fact that the project can be implemented on other diseases as well, a fact reiterated by the logo slogan as well which places diagnostics as a broad term and not particular to typhoid fever alone.
below is my improved logo design:
