## Build an Online Platform for the Project

Our project, __Improve diagnostics of typhoid through Open Science: An Artificial Intelligence-based technique__ consists of various individual parts that collectively make it whole.

Having all of our parts together and available to the public at the click of a link is integral to the success of this project. I have set up a website using [wix](https://manage.wix.com/dashboard/27064fab-0cd0-44ef-9f88-6a536d2892a6/home) that first tells us the needed facts about Mboalab and then breaks down our project into it's relevance and objectives after giving a brief overview of the project.
i have also added a contributions tab that calls on the general public to make contributions to this project via our github page as well as welcome them to add to our database on symptoms of typhoid fever via a link to my undeployed survey.

For those who wish to connect with us on social media, send a private email or call, our contact information is linked at the bottom of our about page.

Thank you.
