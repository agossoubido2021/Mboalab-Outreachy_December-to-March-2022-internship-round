## Design a Data Collection Tool to Record Typhoid Fever Symptoms Data

The objective of this task is to design the data collection system that will be used to collect typhoid fever clinical data symptom variables that will allow us not only to confirm the diagnosis but above all to determine the level of severity of the disease, taking into account, local and context specificities e.g, language.
This tool should enable the acquisition of datasets and be addressed to local healthcare professionals and practitioners, affiliated and having access to patient data records.

For this task, i made use of KoboToolbox to design a data collection tool in the form of a survey.
[KoboToolbox](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/) is a free and open source software with a suite of tools for data collection, using this software, i was able to customize my survey as i desired, i have also included english as the default language for my form with an option for french and this language option can be further edited to include other official languages of various nationalities.
This tool also allows for the collection of structured and unstructured data, with options for images and videos among others. Data can also be easily exported as an excel file, CSV etc
Visualizations can also be made using this tool both online and offline.

A copy of my deployed form can be found [here](https://ee.kobotoolbox.org/x/EbvLUABh)
Mentors who wish to make changes and improvements to my form can do that via this [link](https://kf.kobotoolbox.org/#/forms) and making use of my login details below;
* __username__ : fakrogha_nancy

The general public is welcome to make contributions to this project and for those who wish to build a project using the [KoboToolbox](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/), you are advised to create an account.
There are two publicly-available instances to choose from, select the one that is best suited to your needs;
* [Unlimited Use for Humanitarian Organizations](https://kobo.humanitarianresponse.info/accounts/register/#/) - This instance is provided by UN OCHA, has unlimited submissions, unlimited data storage and unlimited projects.
* [Researchers, Aid Workers & Everyone Else](https://kf.kobotoolbox.org/#/forms) - This instance is provided by Kobo Toolbox, has 10,000 submissions per month, 5GB of data storage per month, and unlimited projects.

After creating an account via one of the links listed above, you can customize your own survey in a few easy steps;

#### Create a New Form
We can achieve this step by logging in to our newly created kobotoolbox account, on the homepage, there is a large button labelled "new", clicking on this button results in a "create project" pop up tab where you can choose one of four ways to proceed;
1. Build from scratch
2. Use a template
3. Upload an XLSForm
4. Import an XLSForm via URL

we choose one of the options listed above and get prompted with fields to populate such as the project name, country, etc.

#### Add Variables
The next page that is displayed is one of the most important, here we get to choose how we want our forms to look based on the questions asked and the kind of answer options we provide for our users. By clicking the + sign on this page, we get to add out questions and start building out our form. Hover across the image below to watch the tutorial clip;

#### Preview Form
This step is optional but advised, especially as a first time user and even consequently. Here you get to view your form as an end user and quickly spot errors or anything else you may want to adjust. i also toggled the expand/collapse icon that is closest to the preview eye icon, if for any reason you wish to collapse your form to make your page look less cluttered;

#### Save/Deploy/Delete Form
At this point, after previewing your form and it is to your liking, you can go ahead and save it. To view your recently saved project, you have to return to your list by clicking the list button at the opposite end of the save button, this takes you back to your home page and if you click on your recently saved project, you get to see various tabs containing properties of your project/form, you can click on the form tab to deploy your form or the settings tab to delete it, the data tab is only activated after you have gotten submissions or data on your deployed form.

I hope that these illustrations prove useful in the creation of your first form!
