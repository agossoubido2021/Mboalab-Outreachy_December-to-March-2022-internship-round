### Content for the Projects(MADOT) Online Platform

#### Home Menu
This is the first page a user sees and it contains a short catchy name for the project, which i have chosen to be MADOT and a short bulleted sentence underneath that gives the user an overall idea of what the platform entails.

#### About MADOT Menu
Clicking on "About MADOT" takes us to our project decription page which gives us a better understanding of the project name chosen and the first disease(Typhoid fever) we focus on.
MADOT is an acronym coined from our project title by breaking it down into five important parts, a more detailed breakdown can be found below;
* M - Mboalab (The parent company for our project)
* A - Artificial Intelligence
* D - Diagnosis
* O - Open Science
* T - Typhoid Fever

The next two menus for the online platform are sub menus of the "About MADOT" menu, since they both pertain to the project relevance and objectives.

#### Project Relevance Submenu
Mboalab aims to catalyze sustainable local development and improve people‚Äôs living condition through open science. MADOT is relevant to but not limited to Cameroon and developing or underdeveloped African country.

According to this recently compiled [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_African_countries_by_Human_Development_Index) of developed, developing and underdeveloped countries, using the human development index as a summary measure, we can see that Cameroon ranks at number 22 in Africa, 153rd position in the world and in the medium human development category with as many as 30 more countries following closely behind in the low human development category. Mboalab already aims to facilitate access to basic healthcare as one of its core missions, However, MADOT starts off by tackling one of the major issues prevalent in rural communities of developing and underdeveloped countries, typhoid fever, and ultimately prove useful for a number of other diseases. Typhoid Fever can be passed in the feces and sometimes in the urine of infected people. If you eat food that has been handled by someone who has typhoid fever and who hasn't washed carefully after using the toilet, you can become infected. most people become infected by drinking contaminated water.

 

The bacteria may also spread through contaminated food and through direct contact with someone who is infected or through typhoid carriers (These people, known as chronic carriers, no longer have signs or symptoms of the disease themselves. However, they still shed the bacteria in their feces and are capable of infecting others).

To this end, MADOT's significance to developing, under developed and even rural communities in some developed countries cannot be overemphasized.

#### Project Objectives Submenu
The main objective of MADOT is to create an algorithm based on 18 symptom variables which will allow us not only to confirm the diagnosis of typhoid fever but above all to determine the level of severity of the disease in a cost-efficient manner. The challenge our project is facing is availability of local and high-quality open data. In a bid to fix that and set up a local and robust dataset aligned with the [Metadata Schema 4.4,](https://schema.datacite.org/) we have outlined the following pathways;
* Design interviews for practitioners in order to collect the associations of symptoms that confirm the disease and its level of severity.
* Images collection taking into account the different ethnic groups, gender and age in order to have a heterogeneous dataset to allow us to avoid the biases that may arise and undermine the use of our solution.
* Design the Convolutional Neural Networks to train images and Decision tree to train structured data.

This project aims to facilitate access to basic healthcare in a simple and cost-efficient manner so as to reach the most remote places taking into account, local and context specificities e.g, language, access to constant power supply/internet.

The next section of our project is the call cor contributions section that can be found in the Contributions menu.

#### Contributions Menu
We are calling on the public to join our community and make MADOT a reality for every man, woman and child at risk of this disease around the world. Your contributions are welcome and appreciated on our [GitHub](https://github.com/Mboalab/Mboalab-Outreachy_December-to-March-2022-internship-round/blob/main/Starter%20Tasks/List%20of%20all%20project's%20Tasks.md) page. Help us improve the quality of a life today!!! üëç

The public is also welcome to take our survey that will be used to collect typhoid fever clinical data symptom variables that will allow us not only to confirm the diagnosis but above all to determine the level of severity of the disease.
The survey can be found [here](https://ee.kobotoolbox.org/x/EbvLUABh)
For contributors who are eager and willing to build their own forms, surveys etc. We have included a step by step guide and videos to aid you in doing so on our data collection menu, we look forward to learning and collaborating with you.

#### Data Collection Menu
In this [menu](https://nancyfaks.wixsite.com/my-site/ex) of our online platform, we give end users a breakdown of the steps used in creating our forms and include videos to drive home the message.

#### Communities Menu
Our final menu on the platform is our communities menu, here, we have included profiles of the project's mentors and the means to reach them, should contributors or the general public have a need for it.
We have also included the names of our foremost sponsors([Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/#eligibility) and [Mboalab](https://www.mboalab.africa/)) who have jointly made this project a possibility and a reality.
Finally, we make mention of the fact that we accept contributions from all over the world and we do not discriminate based on race, gender, sexuality or other bias.

Thank you.
