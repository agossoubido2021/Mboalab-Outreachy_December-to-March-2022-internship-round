# Task 1: Designing a Logo for the Project

## Objective: 
The brand of a project is paramount to deliver the message about its value and goals. A proper brand helps the project get the necessary support and make an impact on all the stages of the project life cycle. A logo can quickly grab viewers’ attention and communicate the project’s core objectives and importance in an interesting way. Logos are a point of identification; they’re the symbol that external people use to recognize the project's unique brand and value. Because a good logo is a visual, aesthetically pleasing element, it triggers positive recall about the project that the name alone might not. A good logo can pique the interest of the public and invite them to learn more about the project.

## Tool Used:
I used Adobe Illustrator, a professional vector-based design and drawing program for the logo design. 

## Logo Description:

# Color codes: 
The main logo color is green with different shades of green used in a radial gradient. Some of the color codes used include:
- #63F0D3
- #009C87
- #2FCC87
- #00A38B

# Description: 
As the project implies improving diagnostics of typhoid through Artificial Intelligence, the main focus during the logo design was the representation of the medical and technological aspects of the project. This was done as follows:

- The Medical Cross Symbol: This symbolizes health services and can often be seen in hospitals, pharmacies and other medical establishments.

- Circuit design: This represents the tech aspect of the project.

- Circular shape: Circles are a symbol of stability and collaboration. Logos that use rings are designed to be welcoming, positive, and focused on a message of togetherness which goes with the aim this project which is to help improve diagnostics of typhoid.

- Green color: Green represents growth, and evokes a feeling of relaxation and healing which is inline with this project which is improve diagnostics of typhoid.
