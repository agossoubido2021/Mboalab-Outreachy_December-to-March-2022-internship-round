Task 4: Create content for the project's online platform

#Project Goals, Relevance and Objectives

The goal of this project is to improve the diagnosis of Typhiod fever by combining Artificial Intellgience systems with irreplaceable human cinician for acquiring human clinical data for improved diagnosis 

This can be accomplished by the use of the following:
 -Microcultures test with blood
 -Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) to train images
 -Decision tree to train structured data
 
The use of the methods above will lead to appropriate diagnostics of typhoid fever and more importantly, the severity level of the disease.

###Project Description
####About Mboalab
Mboalab is an open and collaborative space located in Yaounde, Cameroon. It is a laboratory for social innovation, community education, collaboration and mediation at the service of the community.
Mboalab Biotech is focused on making biotechnology research and tools readily available to labs worldwide through scientific research and development and local production of reagents. 
In addition, we provide scientific research projects which aims to tackle local health issues and provide internship opportunities and training programs for young local scientists.

####Project Background
 Typhoid or Enteric fever is one of the most infectious human diseases in Cameroon and Africa. There are a number of well-known and conventional method of diagnosis of typhoid fever. However, these tests have limitations such as;
 1. Complexities in result
 2. Expensive tests
 3. Lack of standardized methods
 4. Misinterpretation of results
 
 Thus, misdiagnosis is commonly experienced in most healthcare facilities. In addition, the diagnosis of Typhoid involves several levels of uncertainities.
 We will use the combination of open science-AI and human clinicians for the accomplishment of this project.
 
 ####Project Challenges
 **The main challenge of this project is availability of local and high quality open data.**
 Hence, there is need to develop accurate data collection tools and acquire datasets from reliable sources.  
 
 ####Opportunities and Solutions
 
  Mboalab propose the following methods for typhoid fever diagnosis;
 -Microcultures test with blood
 -Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) to train images
 -Decision tree to train structured data
 **NOTE**: For CNN algorithm, everything will depend on the volume of images available.
 
 ####Project Tools
 In addition to the methods above, we will use the most fitting and accurate data collection tools for this project. This tools can be in the form of Questionnaires, surveys, interviews.
 
This data collection tools must be;
-Designed in order to collect the associations of symptoms that confirm the disease and its level of severity;
-Collect feedback about delveloped tool from the community;
-Addressed to local health care professionals and practitioners affiliated and having access to patients data records;
-Able to acquire of prospective and retrospective Datasets;
-Able to take into account local and context specificties (Language, access to specific resources etc..).

Furthermore, we will need to set up a local and robust dataset subdivided into two datasets which consists of;
1. Images
2. Structured data
The dataset should be open , interoperable and aligned with the Metadata Schema 4.4 (https://schema.datacite.org/) 

####Discussion. 
Therefore, from the project description above, we are in need of contributors to help us achieve the following:
- Design interviews for health practioners in order to collect the associations of symptoms and its severity levels with the use of the most fitting data colection tools described above.
-Collect images by taking into consideration, different ethnic groups, age and gender
-Design the Convolutional Neural Networks to train images and Decision tree to train structured data
