Github is a web-based interface that utilizes Git, the open-source version control system that allows millions of users to roll out an independent
improvement to site pages simultaneously. It is a development platform where developers, communities, and companies build, ship, and maintain their software. Github encourages real-time collaboration, reduces the risk of duplicates or conflicting work, and decreases production time.
Developers and non-developers use Github for various purposes. Developers use it to build code, track changes, and profer solutions to problems
that might arise at the production stage while non-developers can use it to create, edit and update website content. Millions of developers can work on a single project at the same time from different locations without obstruction.

There are some common terms to get associated with when using Github. They are:
1. Repository: Often called `repo`.This is a folder that contains the files and version histories.
2. Branch: this is a workspace where changes can be made that won't have an effect on the live site.
3. Markdown(.md): this is a way to write in Github that converts plain text to Github codes.
4. Commit changes: it saves changes that are made to a file within the repo.
5. Pull Request: commonly known as PR, is the way to ask for changes made to a branch to be joined or merged to another branch which also allows multiple users to see, review and discuss work done.

 ## Writing Syntax in Github.
You can create headings using the hashtag,`#` symbol before your heading text. Headings come in six levels and each tag represents the levels. 
For example: # The largest heading
             ## The second heading
             ##### The smallest heading

You can style text by laying emphasis with bold, italic, or strikethrough text.
Example: style         syntax           example
         bold       ** ** or __ __     **I am bold**
         italic     * * or _ _         *I am italic*
     Strikethrough    ~~ ~~            ~~Strikethrough~~

Quoting text is done using >.
Example: > This is a quote
 
Quoting code is done using single backticks.
Example: Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that are yet to be committed.
To format code in a block, use triple backticks.
Example: ```
         git status
         git add
         git commit
        ```
You can comment on issues and pull requests using markdown. Creating a task list is a tool for tracking issues and pull requests. Example:
- [ x] Turn on GitHub Pages
- [ ] Outline my portfolio
- [ ] Introduce myself to the world
Use the preview tab in the comment section to check the Markdown format.

You can embed images into your issues, PR, contributions, comment, and .md files. To display the image, add ! and enclose the alt text in [], then the link of the image in parenthesis().
Example: ![This is an image](https://emojipedia.org/smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes/)

You can mention people, or teams on Github by typing @ with their username or team name which will then notify them and bring them to the conversation. Example: @Laranwaezeigwe-eze How is it going?

You can also make reference to an issue or a pull request number or title by including # to it.
Example: # Task 0

You can upload images by drag and drop, selecting from the browser, and pasting it and it can be done to your issues, PR in your repository.

Another use of your Github is the use of emojis. Add emoji to your writeup by typing :EMOJICODE: will give a list of emoji and once you are able to locate the type you need, simply click TAB or ENTER to complete.
Example: @Laranwaezeigwe-eze :+1: This looks great! :shipit:
