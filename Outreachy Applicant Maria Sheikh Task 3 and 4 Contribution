Hi, 
I have completed two tasks 3 and 4 as my contribution for Outreachy Internship. Links to my work are as follow:

**Task 3:**
As data collection tool, I have  utilized google forms as a tool for data collection of typhoid symptoms. The reason to go for the
tool was that it is free and openly available with no provided limitation regarding number of participations and forms.

Questionare is designed based on typhoid symptoms mentioned in following research paper:
Oguntimilehin, Abiodun & Adetunmbi, Adebayo & O.B, Abiola. (2013). 
A Machine Learning Approach to Clinical Diagnosis of Typhoid Fever.
International Journal of Computer Science and Information Technology. 02. 671-676. 

Link to google form created is : https://forms.gle/C9ELvrBNkEpxn6g99
